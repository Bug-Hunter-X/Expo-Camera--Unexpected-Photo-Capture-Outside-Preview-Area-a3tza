In the original `cameraBug.js`, the `onTouchTap` event handler didn't check tap coordinates against the camera preview's boundaries. The solution in `cameraBugSolution.js` adds this check.  The tap coordinates are obtained from the event object and compared against the camera preview's dimensions.  A photo is only captured if the tap falls within the preview area.  This prevents unintended captures resulting from taps outside of the intended control zone.
